All the files in this directory except two are text files, and most of them are
examples of PMW input files. Comments explain what they do. The non-text files
are ConcatArabicChars.zip, which contains a JavaScript application for
converting Arabic words into suitable PMW escape sequences, and
CustomBuiltKeySig.zip, which contains another JavaScript application for
generating PMW escape sequences for non-standard key signatures. The 
contributor of these sent the following notes regarding the Arabic strings
coding utility: 

  - Syllables for lyrics now support using #, in addition to -.

  - But for other strings, e.g. in headers, it's impossible to use either
    a full-stop (for abbreviations, for example) or a colon (as in "Lyrics by:
    ***"). 
     
    - The Arabic font used simply does not contain such glyphs in the
      first place.  
     
    - If the text contains more than one such punctuation marks, the job  of
      slicing and swapping the text fragments would be next to impossible.
